# fake-instagram-profile-detector
This is the repo for a Coursera project. 
Fake and spam accounts are a major problem in social media. Many social media influencers use fake Instagram accounts to create an illusion of having so many social media followers. Fake accounts can be used to impersonate or catfish other people and be used to sell fake services/products.

In this hands-on project, I built and trained a Multi Layer Neural Network model to detect spam/fake Instagram accounts. Work includes:
1. Import and visualize dataset.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis
3. Split and Standardize training and testing dataset
4. Build a simple Multi Layer Neural Network model
5. Compile and fit Deep Learning model to training data.
6. Assess the performance of trained deep learning model and ensure its generalization using various KPIs such as accuracy, precision and recall.
